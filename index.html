            <p class="game-des">As part of the SIT102 Introduction to Programming course, I developed a space-themed game using C++ and the SplashKit library. The project involved implementing various features such as player movement, power-up integration, and heads-up display (HUD) design. I modified the gameâ€™s codebase to center the player sprite on the screen, enabled ship selection via keyboard inputs, and added multiple power-ups with different effects, such as fuel and shields. Additionally, I designed and coded a dynamic HUD to display critical in-game information, including player location, score, and fuel levels. I further expanded the game by implementing dynamic arrays to manage multiple power-ups, enhancing gameplay complexity and interactivity. The project required a solid understanding of C++ fundamentals, game logic, and object-oriented programming principles, culminating in a functional and engaging game experience.</p>

            <p class="uno-des">Developed an automated fish feeder and monitoring system using Arduino Uno to maintain optimal conditions for aquatic life. The system integrates multiple sensors, including a pH sensor for measuring water acidity, a temperature sensor for monitoring water temperature, and a float sensor to prevent overflow. A servo motor is used to dispense food at scheduled intervals, while an LCD screen provides real-time data and system status updates. This project ensures efficient feeding and continuous monitoring of water quality, contributing to a healthier aquatic environment.</p>

            <p class="menu-des">Developed a restaurant ordering system in C++ that features a dynamic menu display, allowing users to select items, specify quantities, and view prices. The system automatically updates the available stock and calculates the total bill, providing a complete and user-friendly ordering experience. This project involved using object-oriented programming principles, including structures for menu items and functions for order processing and inventory management. The system showcases strong C++ programming skills, effective data management, and the ability to create practical, real-world applications that simulate an online ordering environment with real-time inventory updates.</p>
